# Power Efficient Remote Monitoring Application

In this example we will create a remote monitoring application that takes asynchronous sensor readings using the [Promise library](https://developer.electricimp.com/libraries/utilities/promise). We will conserve power by putting the device to sleep between readings and connecting periodically to send the readings we have collected. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Kit, impExplorer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board.

## Skill level

**Advanced**

This example will focus on writing Squirrel code. Please visit the [**Getting Started Guide**](https://developer.electricimp.com/gettingstarted) on the Electric Imp Dev Center to learn how to configure your device with BlinkUp™ and how to use the Electric Imp IDE, impCentral™.

    * [impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node](https://developer.electricimp.com/hardware/resources/reference-designs/sensornode)
    * [impC001 Breakout Board](https://developer.electricimp.com/hardware/resources/reference-designs/impc001breakout)

## Instructions

* Activate your device with BlinkUp.
* Log into [impCentral](https://impcentral.electricimp.com/login).
* Create a new [Product](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/impcentral/impcentralintroduction#app-products) and [Development Device Group](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/impcentral/impcentralintroduction#app-development-devicegroup).
* Copy and Paste the Device Code into the **Device Code** pane in the impCentral code editor.
* Locate the HAL for your hardware. The HAL files can be found on GitHub in the repositories linked below. Find the `.HAL.nut` file in the repository that matches your hardware.
    * [imp006 Breakout Board HAL](https://github.com/electricimp/imp006BreakoutBoardHAL)
    * [impExplorer Kit HAL](https://github.com/electricimp/ExplorerKitHAL)
    * [impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node HAL](https://github.com/electricimp/SensorNodeHAL)
    * [impC001 Breakout Board HAL](https://github.com/electricimp/CellularBreakoutHAL)
* Copy and Paste the HAL table into the code in the *HARDWARE ABSTRACTION LAYER* section. Below is an example of what a HAL table will look like when inserted into the code. **Do not** copy and paste from this example, use the HAL found in GitHub.

```squirrel
// HARDWARE ABSTRACTION LAYER
// ---------------------------------------------------
// HAL's are tables that map human readable names to
// the hardware objects used in the application.

// Copy and Paste Your HAL here
ExplorerKit_001 <- {
    "LED_SPI" : hardware.spi257,
    "SENSOR_AND_GROVE_I2C" : hardware.i2c89,
    "TEMP_HUMID_I2C_ADDR" : 0xBE,
    "ACCEL_I2C_ADDR" : 0x32,
    "PRESSURE_I2C_ADDR" : 0xB8,
    "POWER_GATE_AND_WAKE_PIN" : hardware.pin1,
    "AD_GROVE1_DATA1" : hardware.pin2,
    "AD_GROVE2_DATA1" : hardware.pin5
}
```

* Assign your hardware class variables. In the *Application* class before the constructor you will find a number of class variables. You will need to re-assign the hardware variables so they look something like the example below. **Do not** copy and paste from this example, as these values may differ from the ones in your HAL.

```
// POWER EFFICIENT REMOTE MONITORING APPLICATION CODE
// ---------------------------------------------------
// Application code, take readings from our sensors
// and send the data to the agent

class Application {

    // Time in seconds to wait between readings
    static READING_INTERVAL_SEC = 30;
    // Time in seconds to wait between connections
    static REPORTING_INTERVAL_SEC = 300;
    // Max number of stored readings
    static MAX_NUM_STORED_READINGS = 23;
    // Time to wait after boot before disconnecting
    static BOOT_TIMER_SEC = 60;
    // Accelerometer data rate in Hz
    static ACCEL_DATARATE = 1;

    // Hardware variables
    i2c             = ExplorerKit_001.SENSOR_AND_GROVE_I2C; // Replace with your sensori2c
    tempHumidAddr   = ExplorerKit_001.TEMP_HUMID_I2C_ADDR; // Replace with your tempHumid i2c addr
    accelAddr       = ExplorerKit_001.ACCEL_I2C_ADDR; // Replace with your accel i2c addr

    // Sensor variables
    tempHumid = null;
    accel = null;

    // Message Manager variable
    mm = null;

    // Flag to track first disconnection
    _boot = true;

    constructor() {...}
```

* Copy and paste the Agent Code into the **Agent Code** pane in the impCentral code editor.
* Sign into [Initial State](https://api.init.st/auth/#/login/).
* Find your **Streaming Access Key** on the [My Account page](https://iot.app.initialstate.com/#/account).
* Navigate back to [impCentral](https://impcentral.electricimp.com/).
* In the Agent code enter your **Streaming Access Key** into the *Application* class static variable *STREAMING_ACCESS_KEY* on line 24.
* Hit the **Build and Force Restart** button to start the code.
* Note the agent ID in the logs.
* Navigate back to Initial State, find the Bucket that matches your agent ID.
* Watch your data update in the Source, Lines, Waves and Tile views on the Initial State website.
